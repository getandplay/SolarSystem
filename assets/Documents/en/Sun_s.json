    "Structure":"The photosphere is a thin outermost layer of the Sun. Below photosphere, the Sun becomes opaque. However, the photosphere itself is only slightly less opaque than the air on Earth.",
    "Convective zone":"Thermal columns carry hot material to the surface of the Sun. Once the material cools off, it plunges back towards the hot radiative zone.",
    "Radiative zone":"The radiative zone carries the intense heat of the core outward as thermal radiation, with material rapidly cooling and the density of solar material decreasing a hundredfold from the top of the core to the top of the radiative zone.",
    "Core":"99% of all power generated by the Sun comes from within 24% of the Sun's radius."
