    "Description":"Pluto is the largest object in the Kuiper belt. It is also the largest and the second most massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System.",
    "Aial tilt":"Like Uranus, Pluto is lying on its \"side\", with an axial tilt of 120°, leading to extreme seasonal variations. At its solstices, one-fourth of the planet is in continuous daylight, and one-fourth in continuous darkness.",
    "Moons":"Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. Pluto and Charon are sometimes described as a binary system because the barycenter of their orbit does not lie within either body.",
    "Discovery":"Discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto was originally classified as the 9th planet from the Sun. However, the discovery of similar-sized objects within the Kuiper Belt, prompted the International Astronomical Union to re-classify Pluto in 2006 a dwarf planet."
