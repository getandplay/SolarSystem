    "Description":"Deimos is the outermost and smaller of the two natural satellites of the planet Mars. So small, that it could easily fit inside a medium-sized crater on Earth's moon.",
    "Moving away":"Deimos is slowly moving farther away from Mars. It is believed that it will eventually leave the orbit of Mars."
