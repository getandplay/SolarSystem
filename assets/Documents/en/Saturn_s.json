    "Structure":"Saturn's interior is similar to Jupiter's. Contrary to Jupiter, Saturn's density is lower, making it the least dense planet in the Solar System. Combined with its rapid rotation, Saturn becomes the most oblate planet in our Solar System: Its equatorial and polar diameters vary by almost 10 percent.",
    "Atmosphere":"Due to it's lower gravity, Saturn's atmosphere has more haze than Jupiter's, with blurred features and colors muted into a general yellowish hue. The winds on Saturn are five times as fast as those measured on Jupiter.<br> Saturn radiates 2.5 times more heat than it receives from the Sun, possibly due to the \"raining-out\" of helium deep into its interior creating frictional heat as the helium descends through the lower density hydrogen.
