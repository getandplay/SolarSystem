    "Description":"Hyperion is the second largest irregular (nonspherical) body in the Solar System and the first non-round moon to be discovered. Hyperion is probably a remnant of a larger moon that was destroyed by a major impact.",
    "Sponge":"Hyperion's surface is covered with deep, sharp-edged craters that give it the appearance of a giant sponge. The latest analyses also show that about 40 percent of the moon is empty space.",
    "Chaotic":"Hyperion is the only moon in the Solar System known to rotate chaotically. Its axis of rotation wobbles so much that its orientation in space is unpredictable."
