    "Description":"Rhea is the second-largest moon of Saturn and the ninth largest moon in the Solar System. It is also one of the most heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System.",
    "resurfaced":"Rhea's features could be divided into two regions: The brighter and more heavily cratered areas and the areas in the polar and equatorial region. This difference may indicate there was a major resurfacing event some time in Rhea's history."
