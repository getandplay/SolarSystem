    "Structure":"Currently, we have little direct information about the internal structure of Venus. However, its similar size and density to Earth suggests that they share a common internal structure. The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of plate tectonics on Venus, likely due to the dry surface and mantle. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major resurfacing event."
