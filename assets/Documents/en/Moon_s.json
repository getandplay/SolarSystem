    "Structure":"The uppermost parts of the Lunar crust forms broken surface layers referred to as regolith and megaregolith. Regolith comprises small rocks and dust formed by impact processes and is only a few metres thick. Megaregolith is a layer of highly fractured bedrock several kilometres thick which lies directly under the regolith.",
    "Mantle":"Moonquakes have been found to occur deep within the Moon's mantle. These occur with monthly periodicities and are related to tidal stresses caused by the eccentric orbit of the Moon about the Earth.",
    "Inner core":"Lunar core is small, with a radius of about 20% the size of the Moon."
