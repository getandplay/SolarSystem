    "Structure":"The outer crust is rich in silicon, oxygen, iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium - all of which could be used in the development of future human outposts on Mars.",
    "Mantle":"Silicate mantle was once very active, giving rise to many of the planet's distinctive surface features, but which now appears to be dormant.",
    "Core":"Like Earth, Mars has undergone differentiation, resulting in a dense core primarily comprising iron and nickel, but with around 17% sulfur, which renders the core partially liquid."
