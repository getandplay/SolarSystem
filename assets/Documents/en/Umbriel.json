    "Description":"Umbriel is the third largest of Uranus' moons. It is also one of the darkest moons, reflecting only 16 percent of the light that strikes its surface.",
    "Crater":"The most curious feature of Umbriel is a large, bright ring on the moon's dark surface. It is unclear what created the distinctive feature, although it may be frost deposits associated with an impact crater."
