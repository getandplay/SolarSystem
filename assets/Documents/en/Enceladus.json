    "Description":"Enceladus is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn. It has the highest albedo of any known object in the Solar System, reflecting almost 100% of the sunlight Enceladus receives.",
    "Cryovolcanoes":"Cryovolcanoes at the south pole shoot large jects of water vapor into space. The whole of Saturn's E Ring is believed to have been made from these ice particles.",
    "Water":"Enceladus seems to have liquid water under its icy surface. This could be caused by internal heat as a result of tidal forces from Saturn.",
    "Life":"Because of the apparent liquid water near the surface, Enceladus may be one of the best spots for humans to look for extraterrestrial life."
