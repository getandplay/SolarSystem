    "Description":"Mimas is a small Saturnian moon. It is also the smallest known astronomical body to have its shape rounded by its own gravity.",
    "Scar":"Although the surface of Mimas is heavily cratered the most striking feature is a gigantic crater known as Herschel. It is almost 1/3 of the entire moon's diameter."
