    "Structure":"Earth's crust, together with the uppermost parts of the mantle forms the lithosphere. The lithosphere is broken into a series of tectonic plates which \"float\" on a more elastic part of the upper mantle. The motion of these plates gives rise to earthquakes and volcanism.",
    "Mantle":"The Earth's mantle is a rocky shell which accounts for 84% of the planet's volume. The very uppermost regions of the mantle are the most solid and are relatively rigid.",
    "Outer core":"The temperature difference within the outer core drives convection currents, with hot liquid metals rising, cooling and then descending back towards the hot inner core. These convection currents power the Earth's magnetic field.",
    "Inner core":"Although the temperature in the inner core is thought to be about the same as the surface of the Sun, the extreme pressure prevents it from becoming liquid."
