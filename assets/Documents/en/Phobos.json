    "Description":"Phobos is the larger and closer of the two natural satellites of Mars. It is a small, irregularly shaped object, closer to its primary than any other known planetary moon.",
    "Proximity":"Phobos is so close that it orbits Mars faster than Mars rotates. As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise and set twice each Martian day.",
    "Collision":"Phobos is drawing closer to Mars and in 50 million years it will either collide with the planet or break up into a planetary ring."
