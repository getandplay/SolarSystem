        "Description":"Callisto is the outermost of the Galilean satellites and the third largest satellite in the Solar System. Callisto is also the most heavily cratered object in the Solar System.",
        "Landscape":"Callisto has shown no signs of resurfacing since first impacts have molded its surface. Therefore, it has the oldest landscape in the Solar System, with a surface age of about 4 billion years."
