    "Description":"Despite the fact that Dione is only a small Saturnian moon, it is still the 15th largest moon in the Solar System, and its mass is greater than the mass of all known smaller moons combined.",
    "Rotated":"Heavily cratered areas on Dione are unexpectedly located on the trailing hemisphere, so it has been theorized that a more recent impact spun Dione around 180 degrees."
