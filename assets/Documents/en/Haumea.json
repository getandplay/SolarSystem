    "Description":"Discovered in December 2004, Haumea is the third closest dwarf planet from the Sun and the fastest spinning known large object in the Solar System.",
    "Shape":"Haumea's extreme elongation is probably caused by its rotation - so rapid, it turned Haumea into an ellipsoid and made it the least spherical of the dwarf planets.",
    "Origin":"In the early Solar System, Haumea may have been much like Pluto, composed half of rock and half of water. Billions of years ago, a large object is theorized to collided with the body, knocking most of the surface ice away and imparting a rapid spin to the dwarf planet.",
    "Moons":"Haumea has two moons: The larger, Hi'iaka, is only 1% as massive as Haumea, while the smaller, Namaka, weight only about a tenth as much. Both moons are thought to be composed of almost pure water-ice, which may have originally come from Haumea itself."
