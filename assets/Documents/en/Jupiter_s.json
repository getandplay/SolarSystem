    "Structure": "Jupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter. There is no surface, only a gradual change from the atmosphere. Conditions blend smoothly from gas to liquid as the temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily toward the core.",
    "Mantle": "The surrounding liquid hydrogen is responsible for Jupiter's massive magnetic field, which is 10 times stronger than Earth's, with the magnetic pole strength being nearly 20,000times stronger than Earth's pole strength.",
    "Core": "Jupiter is thought of having a dense core. The exact composition of the core is unknown, as are the properties of materials at the temperatures and pressures of those depths, but it is thought to be solid."
