    "Description": "Ariel is the fourth largest of Uranus' moons. Ariel's surface shows signs of more recent geological activity and appears to be the youngest of all the moons of Uranus.",
    "Surface": "The most striking feature of Ariel is the complex network of deep rift valleys crisscrossing the entire surface of the moon. These canyons are very similar to those on Mars."
