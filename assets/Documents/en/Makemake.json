    "Description":"Discovered in March 2005, Makemake is the second furthest dwarf planet to the Sun. It is also the 3rd largest dwarf planet, just slightly smaller and dimmer than Pluto.",
    "Composition":"Makemake's surface is covered with large amounts of almost pure methane ice, which makes the dwarf planet appear reddish-brown in color.",
    "Lack of Data":"With no detected moons and the lack of variations in its brightness, it is difficult to determine Makemake's mass, density or rotation period."
