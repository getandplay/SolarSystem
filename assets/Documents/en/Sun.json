    "Description":"The Sun, also referred to as \"Sol\", is the star at the center of the Solar System. Sun's mass accounts for some 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.",
    "Composition":"Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass is hydrogen, with the rest mostly helium. Only 1.69% of the Sun(which is still 5 628 times the mass of the Earth) is made up of heavier elements like carbon, iron neon and oxygen.",
    "Distance":"The mean distance of the Sun from the Earth is approximately 149.6 million kilometres (1 AU). On average, it takes light from the Sun about 8 minutes and 19 seconds to reach the Earth.",
    "Galaxy":"Once thought to be a relatively insignificant star, the Sun is now considered to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy. It is located about two-thirds of the way out from the centre of the Milky Way."
