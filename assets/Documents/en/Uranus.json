    "Description":"Uranus is the third largest of the Solar System's gas giants. It is the coldest planet in the Solar System.",
    "Discovery":"Uranus was the first to be discovered by the use of the modern telescope, with its discovery credited to the English astronomer William Herschel in 1781.",
    "Axial tilt":"Uranus has an axial tilt of 97.77°, meaning it effectively rolls around the Sun \"on its side\" compared to the other planets in the Solar System.",
    "Observation":"Thile in Opposition (from the Sun, relative to the Earth), Uranus becomes visible to the naked-eyes. It would appear as a faint star under dark sky conditions."
