    "Structure":"Neptune's blue color is much more vivid than that of Uranus, which has a similar amount of methane - so an unknown component is presumed to cause Neptune's intense color.",
    "Atmosphere":"Neptune generates significant amounts of internal heat through processes that are not clearly understood. This drives the fastest winds in the Solar System and gives rise to distinctive high-altitude bands of cloud as well as generating gigantic anticyclonic storms.",
    "Mantle":"The fluid mantle has high electrical conductivity and gives rise to the planet's magnetic field."
